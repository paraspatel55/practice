        <b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b> (2 October 1869 â€“ 30 January 1948) was
        an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who
        employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for
        India's independence from British rule.

        <ul>
          <li>Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891</li>
          <li> After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. </li>
          <li>He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years.</li>
          <li> It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights.</li>
          <li> In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.</li>
          <li>Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving <i>swaraj</i> or self-rule</li>
          <li>Gandhi adopted the short <i>dhoti</i> woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor.</li>
          <li>He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest.</li>
          <li>Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942.</li>
          <li>Gandhi is considered the Father of the Nation in India and is commonly called <b>Bapu</b>.</li>
